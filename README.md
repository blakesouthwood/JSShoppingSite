# JSShoppingSite
Iphone web site shopping, boolean search, client side JS DB
The code was originally written for a laptop and then modified to work on the iPhone.
The difficulty was having pull down menus work and the frequent changes made of the search interface
until it was as simple as possible and had working memory.

The data in the 2d array is dummy data for items that will be in the shop.
All that remains is JSON code to talk to a real DB.
I was trying to avoid having to use shop.js code and I wanted to see if
I could make a shopping site in pure JS.

The search uses the GTI dual clutch design of changing two values on the fly dynamically with built
in ands for true boolean searching which uses values in arrays but the array position is the same.

This can be used by anyone if they wish. The other tricky part was making the pics clickable to 
swap from the front view of the hat or shirt to the back view. That was a hard algorthm to conquer.

The design of teh shopping cart is unique for being able to change item colors and number on the fly.
The design evolved and only after playing around with it does it make more sense.
